# About repository
This project - my first experience with preprocessor SASS in syntax SCSS, and of course, another practice in HTML/CSS development.  
I used programms for project build and advanced work with psd templates.   
# Completed work
* Document validation  
The resulting site is fully verified using the service https://validator.w3.org
* Project build  
For project build I used "Prepros" - https://prepros.io/ which also optimize images and added prefixes.
* BEM  
I used the metodology BEM from Yandex - https://en.bem.info/ for naming classes and creating a project structure.  
* Psd template  
Also I tried to work with "Avocode" - https://avocode.com/ which greatly accelerated the development process.
* Display  
Used only fluid development with limited content width, because it's just traning with SCSS.
